## The Moderation Interface

### Reports
This is the first tab that will open when you go to the moderation menu. It's where you can see any reports that have been sent from people on toot.garden, and from other instances reporting someone on toot.garden. The tabs are pretty straightforward, they switch between reports that have been handled, and not, and it allows you to sort between local and remote reports.
